# Peripersonal-Space-2

A New Peripersonal Space Repository. Made 10/22/2019 to fix previous problems with the old repository.

The *version* of Unity for this project is 2019.2.6f1

Project Goals: The goals of this project were to better understand peripersonal space in a virtual reality environment. We aimed specifically to understand how the relative size of your environment affects your reaction time and feeling of claustrophobia (or invasion of personal space). 


Project Specifications: This project created three identical rooms, all varying by a factor of 3 for the width. The first room was 3.33units wide, the second 10 units, and the third room 30 units wide. All else was kept equal and fairly simple in order to keep the user from being distracted. 4 avatars were created to walk towards the user at equal intervals, and the user then responded by clicking A on the haptic feedback instrument. All responses were measured using reaction time and distance from user. 


Project Findings: After many trials, we found that a pattern emerged. When the room got bigger, the distance from user also got bigger. This is to say that when the room was bigger, people clicked A sooner and were uncomfortable at a farther distance. We believe this is because when the user has time to think about the decision, they tend to understand that they do not want anyone approaching their personal space. 


Further Areas for Research: We think a few areas of peripersonal space could be further explored using this model. First, we think that the lighting in the room could affect how someone reacts to approaching avatars. Secondly, we were suggested by an international professor to look into how people from different countries respond to these avatars, with the hypothesis that some countries and their cultures are more likely to allow people close (Madrid), while others (Nashville) may give people much more distance. Finally, we believe that there could be interesting data collected on the effect of the avatar's gender on reaction time. We did not control for this variable in our study, despite having a male and female character. Race may also affect reaction time. All of these areas would be interesting to help better understand peripersonal space and our perceptions in the virtual world. 

Best - the Peripersonal Space team!
